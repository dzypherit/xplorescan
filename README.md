An all-in-one command-line tool for blockchain explorers, simplifying searches for addresses, transaction hashes, and more without the need to remember multiple explorer URLs for different chains. 🛰️🌐💻

Have suggestions in mind? [Let me know!](https://github.com/warengonzaga/xplorescan/issues)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Explore wallet address on eth by running the following command:

```bash
npx xplorescan address eth 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

## ❣️ Inspiration

I believe in the saying "necessity is the mother of invention". I created this tool because I need a simple and fast way to explore blockchain data without the need to remember multiple explorer URLs for different chains. I work at [@thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com) and we are building a decentralized web platform that supports multiple chains (700+ EVMs). This tool will help me and my team to simplify our workflow and make it easier to explore blockchain data.

## ⚡ Features

- 🚀 **Fast and Easy**: No need to remember multiple explorer URLs for different chains.
- 🌐 **Multi-Chain Support**: Supports multiple chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and more.

## 🕹️ Usage

npx xplorescan <command> <chain> <input>
```

### 🏠 Address Command

```bash
npx xplorescan address <chain> <wallet address>
```
